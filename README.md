Jena Event Sourcing
===================

This is a hack / experiment to implement an event sourcing triple store on top
of Apache Jena and Fuseki.

The main application can be built through Maven, and for the embedded HTML demo
interface you need to fetch some components using bower and the supplied script
(see the `pages` directory).
